### Learn about Authgear&#x20;

Authgear contains the following high-level components:

#### Authenticate on the Web/Mobile App

* **Client App SDKs** - for developers to quickly implement authentication with Auth UI on your web and mobile applications. Check out [Start Building](get-started/start-building/) for tutorials and API References.
* **Auth UI** - is the default batteries included UI for login, signup and setting page. You can customize the style via the **Portal**, including the CSS and HTML of each page**.**
* **Authentication API** (coming soon) - for developers to implement their own login, signup and reauthenticate UI (e.g. a mobile native view); or to define a customized login, signup and reauth flow.
* [**Use Authgear as OpenID Connect Provider**](how-to-guide/authenticate/oidc-provider.md) - for developers to use Authgear with other software that already support OIDC login, you can use Authgear as an OpenID Connect Provider.

#### Backend Authentication and Integrations

* [**Backend Integration**](get-started/backend-integration/) - explain the common approach of using Access Token or Cookies (JWT or random string) to authenticate an API or HTTP Requests.
* [**Admin API**](reference/apis/admin-api/) - allow your backend to interact directly with Authgear for user management purpose.
* [**Events and Hooks**](how-to-guide/events-hooks/) - call external web endpoint or use the hosted type-script to customize the behaviour of Authgear. E.g. blocking certain type of sign up, or call external endpoint for each login

#### Management Portal

* **Authgear Portal** - You can configure your projects, manage users, check out [audit log](how-to-guide/monitor/audit-log.md), or customize the **AuthUI**
