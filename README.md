# Authgear Overview

As **Auhgear** is constructed on the [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) (OIDC) standard, it supports a wide range of identity providers, including [Google](https://developers.google.com/identity), [Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/deployment/depa64848f3a/web), and [Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/products/active-directory/) (AD). Authgear enables developers to integrate **multiple authentication methods**, such as [social logins](https://www.authgear.com/features/social-login), [passwordless](https://www.authgear.com/features/passwordless-authentication), [biometrics logins](https://www.authgear.com/features/biometric-authentication), [one-time-password (OTP) with SMS/WhatsApp](https://www.authgear.com/features/whatsapp-otp), and multi-factor authentication (MFA)**.**&#x20;

Authgear takes care of the heavy lifting in terms of user authentication, making it easier and faster to implement by integrating it into various types of applications - from single-page web apps to mobile applications to API services. You can also change how the end-users see your [signup and login pages](https://www.authgear.com/solutions/customer-identity-and-access-management) with a **user-friendly drag-drop low-code** dashboard. Most importantly, you can [get started](https://accounts.portal.authgear.com/signup) **with Authgear for free**.
