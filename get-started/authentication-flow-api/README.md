# Authentication Flow API

The Authentication Flow API is an HTTP API to create and run authentication flow. You can use this API to create your own custom UI for login and signup pages.

In order to use the Authentication Flow API, you need to configure a Custom UI URI in the Authgear portal, and then implement code that makes HTTP requests to the API endpoints.

The following flowchart shows the steps in a simple Authentication Flow API implementation:
