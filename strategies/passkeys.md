# Passkeys

Passkeys replace password and other passwordless login methods. It is built on the WebAuthn standard (also known as FIDO Sign-in), which uses public key cryptography to authenticate the user. With 1 click, Authgear upgrades your app to support this cutting-edge auth technology.

#### Platform support and Multi-devices

The passkey standard is supported on the latest versions of Chrome, Safari and Firefox browsers. On iOS 16 and macOS 13 (Ventura), [Apple has added passkey support](https://developer.apple.com/passkeys/) to the iCloud Keychain service. A passkey is synchronized and relayed with an iCloud account and can be used across a user's devices. [Google](https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/one-step-closer-to-a-passwordless-future/) and [Microsoft](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/expansion-of-fido-standard-and-new-updates-for-microsoft/ba-p/3290633) have also announced the support in their future platforms.

User can login to their accounts using their biometrics easily. On Apple devices, Touch ID and Face ID authorize use of the passkey which then authenticate the user on the app or website.

#### Hardware security keys

Besides the built-in support of all major desktop and mobile platforms, passkeys can also be stored in hardware security keys such as [YubiKeys](https://www.yubico.com/blog/passkeys-and-the-future-of-modern-authentication/), which provide the highest security against attacks.

It will take time for the passkey technology to be available on everyone devices. In the transition stage, it is recommended to enable "Password" or "Passwordless via Email/Phone" in your project so users with non-compatible devices can access your app.
